## Description
**Fibonacci Finder** is a program to give you the `nth` number in the Fibonacci sequence.


## Usage

Using the finder only requires you to pass in which number in the sequence you would like to find.

```ruby
Fibonacci.nth(3) # => 2
Fibonacci.nth(10) # => 55
```

## Accreditation

Big thanks go to [Sunny Mittal](https://github.com/sunny-mittal) for his naming convention of the method `nth`, which is a far better description than my method `position_number`.
